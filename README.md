# Project
Hello there!! This website is created in HTML,CSS,PHP,SQL and JavaScript. The main Moto watch to enable backend to a website and to pratice and check the backend skills .

The live working website is at https://prathameshbhagat.000webhostapp.com/

As the main motive was to focus on the backend skills, hence the help of freely available HTML and CSS templates was taken in order to save time and energy

In place of templates,  Bootastrap was also possible which might enhanced it's beauty, but the help of templates was taken to showcase skills to add back-end to pre-available projects.

As of now ,it dosen't have any kind of data validation just very basic J.S validation is present, just to check if data if present or not , it lacks server-side validation including client-side validation .

You land on index.php page where first you register your self on the site as an admin or user. Then you log in with your phone no and date of birth site checks for data on validation logs you in.

On successfull login,if you are a admin you are shown list of all current users . Also when ever a new user "registers" admin gets a notification,just need to wait for 10 seconds also ,you need not remove it, it  destroys itself within about 3second.
As of now it can notify only 12 concurrent new users others might get ignored or might work as expected.
Update would be added soon .
